# Voluntrain

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.2.

## Running the Web Application

Run `ng serve` to start just the Angular client. Navigate to http://localhost:4200 and you'll see the default Angular app.

`npm run start-server` will start just the node.js server on http://localhost:3000. 

To start both the Angular client and the server at the same time, run `npm run start-all`.
