## Running the Web Application

Run `npm run start-all` to start both the Angular client and the server at the same time. Navigate to http://localhost:4200 to view the web application.

Run `npm start` to start the Angular client on http://localhost:4200. 

Run `npm run start-server` to start only the node.js server on http://localhost:3000. 

## Running the test scripts

Run `npm run test` to start the Mocha test scripts. These scripts test the functions used in server.ts.
